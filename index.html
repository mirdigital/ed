About this essay
This essay is a project of the Steinem Initiative, a pilot program based at Smith College. Our mission is “putting history into action.” The Initiative is developing women’s and gender history as an organizing tool with potential to expand the vision, deepen the analysis, strengthen the strategies, and broaden the base of women’s movements, and ultimately elevate gender within movements for social justice.

By retrieving little-known women’s stories — especially the stories of women of color, sexual minorities, and low-income women who are typically marginalized in accounts of the nation’s past, and by bringing the depth, duration and traditions of women’s activism into view, the Initiative aims to weave new narratives that enrich today’s public debates and invigorate movements around issues of pressing social concern, such as reproductive health, rights and justice.
