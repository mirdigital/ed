About this essay
This essay is a project of the Steinem Initiative, a pilot program based at Smith College. Our mission is “putting history into action.” The Initiative is developing women’s and gender history as an organizing tool with potential to expand the vision, deepen the analysis, strengthen the strategies, and broaden the base of women’s movements, and ultimately elevate gender within movements for social justice.
<p>
By retrieving little-known women’s stories — especially the stories of women of color, sexual minorities, and low-income women who are typically marginalized in accounts of the nation’s past, and by bringing the depth, duration and traditions of women’s activism into view, the Initiative aims to weave new narratives that enrich today’s public debates and invigorate movements around issues of pressing social concern, such as reproductive health, rights and justice.
<p> 
“Race, Reproduction, Resistance” offers a historical overview of African American women’s efforts to gain access to contraception in the first half of the 20th century, from the early stirrings of the movement to legalize birth control in the 1910s to the eve of mass movements for women’s rights and racial equality in the 1960s. Seen from the perspective of women’s agency, their struggle highlights the racial and economic circumstances in which black women organized for sexual and reproductive self-determination at that time/in that era, including hurdles within the African American community as well as obstacles in the white-led birth control movement. Taking us back a century, their story also reminds us of the deep roots of black women’s leadership today in what has become a women-of-color led movement for “reproductive justice,” and of the broad human rights agenda that characterizes it. 
<p> 
In addition to new forms of scholarship, such as this digital essay, the Initiative is working through an activist-in-residence program, curriculum partnerships between community organizations and Smith College faculty and students, and a Gloria &amp Wilma School for Organizers to experiment with ways of putting historical knowledge, archival evidence, and documentation methods in the hands of organizers in formats they can easily use in day-to-day work.
<p>  
The digital medium used here provides direct access to original materials and allows readers to examine the documents in their entirely and engage in the process of interpretation themselves. The embedded documents offer a small sample of primary sources from manuscript collections at the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC), a national archives founded in 1942 and dedicated to documenting women’s lives from the colonial era to the present. The essay invites researchers and organizers to delve more deeply into major collections represented here — Margaret Sanger Papers, Florence Rose Papers, Planned Parenthood Federation of America Records, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts Records, YWCA of the U.S.A. Records. It further encourages researchers to explore the abundance of personal papers, oral histories, and organization records at the SSC that extend this story forward, through the decades of the late 20th century and into the present, as Native American, Latina, and Asian American activists join African American women in movements for reproductive health, rights and justice.
