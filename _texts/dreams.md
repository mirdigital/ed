This is a paragraph. The only way that markdown knows it is a paragraph is when you separate it by a space from the text below it. 
An extra space never hurts.

This is how you do poems 
- Line one of my poem
- Line two of my poem
- Line three of my poem



- Hold fast to dreams
- For if dreams die
- Life is a broken-winged bird
- That cannot fly.
- Hold fast to dreams
- For when dreams go
- Life is a barren field
- Frozen with snow.
